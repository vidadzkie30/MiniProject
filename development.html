                <p>Web Design is essential to bringing a website to life and creating the experience that you want for your end users. <br>Our web design courses will help you polish your HTML and CSS skills while learning about color design, navigation design, and more.</p>

                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>HyperText Markup Language: a set of standards, a variety of SGML, used to tag the elements of a hypertext document. It is the standard protocol for formatting and displaying documents on the World Wide Web.</p>

                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). <br>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript1. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</p>

                    <div class="development-col">
                        <h3>Learn bootstrap</h3>
                        <p>Bootstrap is a term that has different meanings depending on the context. It can refer to a loop at the back of a boot used to pull it on, a technique of loading a program into a computer by means of a few initial instructions which enable the introduction of the rest of the program from an input device, <br>or the technique of starting with existing resources to create something more complex and effective1. In computer science, Bootstrap is also the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites</p>

                        <h3>Flexbox and Grid</h3>
                        <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout models that can be used to create responsive web designs. The main difference is that CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout, while Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout. CSS Grid uses numerical coordinates to position elements, while Flexbox uses relative positioning and margins. <br>Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items, while Grid allows flexible widths as a unit of length</p>

                        <h3>Learn Sass</h3>
                        <p>SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. It is a CSS pre-processor that extends CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) by providing additional functionality and advanced features like variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance1. Sass is an upgrade to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and is fully compatible with every version of CSS. <br>SassScript is itself a scripting language whereas SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax. It makes use of semicolons and brackets like CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets).</p>

                        <h3>Tables</h3>
                        <p>An HTML table is used for arranging data (such as text, images, links etc.) into the tabular design â€” basically, rows and columns. It is a representation of data arranged in rows and columns. In HTML, with the help of tables, you can arrange data like images, text, links and so on into rows and columns of cells. <br>Is there anything else you would like to know about HTML tables?</p>

                        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                        <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design in which the interface adapts to the device's layout, facilitating usability, navigation and information seeking. Responsiveness is possible thanks to media queries, allowing the design to adjust automatically to the browser space to ensure content consistency across devices, <br>and design elements being sized in relative units (%).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="development-col">
                        <h3>Box Model and Layout</h3>
                        <p>In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The box model describes how to measure an element for layout. It defines what size is and how it relates to the content, <br>margin, and padding. The content area of a box contains the actual content of the element, like the text or an image. Around that is placed the padding, which is the spacing inside the box. Then comes the border which is a border around the padding. Finally, the margin is the space outside of the border. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
